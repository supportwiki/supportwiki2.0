### Example 
## ✅ How do you hire for holiday staffing?
Based on my expeirence, I would recommend the following. 

 1. Create a list of the major milestones that you need to accomplish including:
	 1. Staffing Model
	 2. Training materials
	 3. Start dates
	 4. Etc. 
 2. Create a timeline of all events in a gantt chart. This will help get you organized and is how you will communicate progress
 3. I would recommend a group hiring process with a few stages, all intended to batch operations to that you effectively use your time. 
	 1. Job posting & application
	 2. Candidate phone screen
	 6. Group interviews with 10-12 people
	 7. Debrief
	 8. Offer letters and reference checks
 4. It is recommended that you only offer temporary contracts and be very up-front about this since you want every stage of the candidate/employee experience to be flawless.

# Content
There are two core types of content that Support Wiki focuses on. 

 1. Adding a post
 2. Adding content to a post
 3. Asking a new question
 4. Answering a question


# Markdown
To post in Support Wiki, the content should be formatted using Markdown. It can be intimidating at first, but once you get the hang of it you'll realize the power of the tool. 

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML. ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown))

## Guide to using Markdown - 
Once you you spend a few minutes using Markdown, you'll quickly recall the syntax and you can use any text program to type Markdown. If you're unfamiliar with the syntax, here's a [guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) to become familiar with Markdown. 


## Applications to Use
When you're writing your post, you can choose whichever tool you would like. Here's a [long list]([https://dev.to/awwsmm/state-of-markdown-editors-2019-2k49](https://dev.to/awwsmm/state-of-markdown-editors-2019-2k49)) of editors that you can choose from. We recommend using a free version, and using a web-based tool such as [Stack Edit](https://stackedit.io/app) means you don't need to download anything.

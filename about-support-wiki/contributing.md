## Blog Posts

On Support Wiki, blog posts are longer-form ways to express your knowledge. They are intended to be longer pieces, which you're representing expertise on. They can also be be in-depth interviews on a single or wide-ranging topics. Any topic is fair game! 

If you feel that your content is short-form, or your idea isn't fully fleshed out, we suggest posting a Question and subsequent Answer in the Q&A section.

## Q&A

The Q&A section is a place for you to engage with other community members, have lively debates about a topic, and share/receive knowledge. Because we are all often faced with new work challenges questions inevitably arise. It's best to have an expert's help, someone who's been there, to help guide you through a difficult situation. 

### Asking a Question

ðŸ™Œ It's amazing that you've decided to further your knowledge. Here's a guideline for asking a great question on Support Wiki:

* Add lots of details and context so you get a great answer
* Respect anonymity \(when needed\) and the privacy of your company \(don't get fired\)
* Try tweeting a link to your question to reach a wider audience, use the hashtag \#customerwiki
* If you feel comfortable, add your bio to the question

### Answering a Question

### Formatting Your Content

Gitbook also provides a WYSIWYG, which means there's nothing to learn, and you can start contributing right away! 

The easiest and fastest way to format your content for Support Wiki is using Markdown. Though it's a simple language to learn, it can be intimidating at first. Once you get the hang of it you'll realize the power of the tool.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML. 

### Guide to using Markdown -

Once you you spend a few minutes using Markdown, you'll quickly recall the syntax and you can use any text program to type Markdown. If you're unfamiliar with the syntax, [here's a guide to become familiar with Markdown.](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax)

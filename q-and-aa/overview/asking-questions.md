* Add lots of details and context so you get a great answer
* Respect anonimity \(when needed\) and the privacy of your company \(don't get fired\)
* Try tweeting a link to your question to reach a wider audience, use the hashtag \#customerwiki
* If you feel comfortable, add your bio to the question

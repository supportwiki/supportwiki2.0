# Answering Questions

### Answering Questions

Thank you for taking the step to contribute to this project. Your expertise will help others lear and help you refine your thinking. We ask that you answer in a way that you would want your questions answered:

* Assume best intent - you too didn't know how to ride a bicycle at some point
* Answer the next two questions as well. Because you're an expert in this field, you know the next 2-10 steps that will be required, so please think ahead and provide additional help
* Add your bio to the response so that others can learn from your expertise

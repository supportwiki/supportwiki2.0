### Asking a Question

ðŸ™Œ It's amazing that you've decided to further your knowledge. Here's a guideline for asking a great question on Support Wiki:

* Add lots of details and context so you get a great answer
* Respect anonymity \(when needed\) and the privacy of your company \(don't get fired\)
* Try tweeting a link to your question to reach a wider audience, use the hashtag \#customerwiki
* If you feel comfortable, add your bio to the question
